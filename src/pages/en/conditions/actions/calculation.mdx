## Purpose

Performs a calculation and sets the value into another field

- Form fields can be used in the calculation

  - Surrounding with `{fieldName}` tells the calculation to treat the form field value as a number
  - Surrounding with `]{fieldName}[` tells the calculation to treat the form field value as text

- Standard Javascript Math functions and constants can be used
