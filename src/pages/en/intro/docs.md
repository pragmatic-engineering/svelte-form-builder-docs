## Goals

### Build Faster

Out of the box rich functionality and the ability to turn projects around in a fraction of the time it would normally take. Helps you get products to market faster with fewer headaches.

### Bridge Gaps

Allows business leaders and analysts in the organizations to easily take a hands-on approach to addressing their needs while allowing IT to provide minimal oversight.

### Resource Gaps

There are not enough traditional software developers. Why not allow everyone to take part of the app development process, regardless of experience. By increasing the number of people who are able to contribute, it relieves some pressure from the backlog and IT becomes less of a bottle-neck.
